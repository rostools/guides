Reproducibility and open scientific practices are increasingly being
requested or required of scientists and researchers, but training on
these practices has not kept pace. Many scientists and researchers
*want* training, so the demand is there, but the capacity for running,
hosting, and teaching them is still growing. And part of this is the
need to train the trainers. This repository contains tips, help,
resources, and things to do as an instructor of the r-cubed courses.
Check out the the [website](https://guides.rostools.org) for the guides.
