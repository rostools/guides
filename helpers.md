# Being a helper 🤝

Many of the tips in the [Teaching In Class](instructors.md) section also
apply to being a helper, but the helpers job is much much simpler and
easier. The tasks are to help troubleshoot and resolve issues that
learners encounter. The vast majority of issues that you would encounter
would be:

-   The code missing a `,` or `)`.

-   Mistyping the code that is present on the screen.

-   Forgetting to continue the `%>%` in a chain.

As you can see, most issues are around simply having a second pair of
eyes looking at the screen and comparing with what is presented on the
projector.

You realistically don't need to prepare at all as a helper. However, to
best help out, here are some things that you could do to prepare for
being a helper.

-   Reviewing or at least scanning the sessions that you will be helping
    with.
-   Since we teach R largely through the use of the
    [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) set of packages and follow
    the tidyverse way of [writing and styling R
    code](https://style.tidyverse.org/), it helps to have an idea of
    what that looks like by briefly reviewing the links above as well as
    some of the [cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)
    for the tidyverse packages like dplyr, ggplot2, or rmarkdown.
-   Be kind, and remember, your words and how you help *matter a lot*.
    They can make participants feel better or worse. So be kind,
    considerate, and understanding!
