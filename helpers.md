# Being a helper ü§ù

-   Review the curriculum the instructors will be teaching.
-   We teach the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) way of using R,
    meaning we use packages like dplyr, tidyr, rmarkdown, ggplot2, and
    so on.
-   We follow the tidyverse way of [writing and styling R
    code](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
-   Be kind, and remember, your words and how you help *matter a lot*.
    They can make participants feel better or worse. So be kind,
    considerate, and understanding!

Before coming to help, we would recommend taking a look at the tidyverse
style guide as well a quick skim through of the [R for Data Science
book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
