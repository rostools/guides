## Tips for helping


Being a **helper** is much simpler. When you see a participant with a "help" sticky
on their laptop, go and see what help you can provide. A couple things to review
and to keep in mind when helping:

- Review the curriculum the instructors will be teaching.
- We teach the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) way of using R, meaning we use packages
like dplyr, tidyr, rmarkdown, ggplot2, and so on. 
- We follow the tidyverse way of [writing and styling R code](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
- Be kind, and remember, your words and how you help *matter a lot*. They can 
make participants feel better or worse. So be kind, considerate, and understanding!

Before coming to help, we would recommend taking a look at the tidyverse style
guide as well a quick skim through of the [R for Data Science book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
