# Being a helper ü§ù

Many of the tips in the [Teaching In Class](instructors.md) section also
apply to being a helper, but the helpers job is much much simpler and
easier. Here are some things to consider or prepare for.

-   To be able to help out as best you can, we recommend reviewing or at
    least scanning the sessions that you will be helping with.
-   We teach R largely through the use of the
    [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) set of packages and follow
    the tidyverse way of [writing and styling R
    code](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
-   Be kind, and remember, your words and how you help *matter a lot*.
    They can make participants feel better or worse. So be kind,
    considerate, and understanding!
