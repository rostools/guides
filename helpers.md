# Being a helper 🤝

Many of the tips in the [Teaching In Class](instructors.md) section also
apply to being a helper, but the helpers job is much much simpler and
easier. The tasks are to help troubleshoot and resolve issues that
learners encounter. The vast majority of issues that you would encounter
would be:

-   The code missing a `,` or `)`.

-   Mistyping the code that is present on the screen.

-   Forgetting to continue the `%>%` in a chain.

As you can see, most issues are around simply having a second pair of
eyes looking at the screen and comparing with what is presented on the
projector.

## Before the course

You realistically don't need to prepare at all as a helper. However, to
best help out, here are some things that you could do to prepare for
being a helper.

-   Reviewing or at least scanning the sessions that you will be helping
    with.

-   Since we teach R largely through the use of the
    [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) set of packages and follow
    the tidyverse way of [writing and styling R
    code](https://style.tidyverse.org/), it helps to have an idea of
    what that looks like by briefly reviewing the links above as well as
    some of the [cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)
    for the tidyverse packages like dplyr, ggplot2, or rmarkdown.

## During the course

-   When helping during a code-along, keep your voice down and be quiet
    so as not to distract other learners.

-   As much as possible when helping, *do not* touch their keyboard or
    fix the problem yourself. Use your words to *tell* them how to fix
    it. As a helper, you are the "navigator", but they are the "driver".
    They should be typing, not you.

-   Be kind, and remember, your words and how you help *matter a lot*.
    They can make participants feel better or worse. So be kind,
    considerate, and understanding! Avoid words like "just" or "simply"
    or "easy" as they can be demotivating to the learner.

-   For those learners with more complex and persistent
    technical/computer issues, move them over to an area off to the side
    (e.g. at the instructor table) to work on fixing the problem so as
    not to disrupt the session for everyone else.
