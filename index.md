# Welcome!

Listed here are common guides that we use across multiple projects
related to teaching R, reproducible research, and data science. These
guides are used to help support the following courses:

-   [Reproducible Research in R: An introductory workshop on modern data
    analyses and workflows](https://r-cubed.rostools.org/)
-   [Reproducible Research in R: An intermediate workshop on modern
    approaches and workflows to processing
    data](https://r-cubed-intermediate.rostools.org/)

## About creating this website

This website was created using
[Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) to
write the documents, [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to create the book

source material for this course is found on the
[`guides`](https://gitlab.com/rostools/guides) GitLab repository.
