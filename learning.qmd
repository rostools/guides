    tidyr](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tidyr).
-   [StackOverflow for
    dplyr](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dplyr).
-   [StackOverflow for
    ggplot2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggplot2?sort=frequent&pageSize=50).
-   Tip: Combine auto-completion with `::` to find new functions and
    documentation on the functions (e.g. try typing `base::` and then
    hitting Tab to show a list of all functions found in base R).
