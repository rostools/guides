## Tips for helping

- Tables facing projector, so they don't twist their necks
    - Keep groups connected together in tables, have space between the groups 
    for instructors and helpers to walk through
    - If groups are formed, keep a max of 4 participants per group.

### Instructor and helper number

- The recommended number of instructors for a 25-35 class size is about 3-6
instructors (~1 instructors for every 1-2 sessions).
If there are more instructors, than less helpers are needed. 
- A recommended ratio of instructor/helper to participant is about 1 to 4-6,
which we've found ensures the smoothest learning experience.
- Once you have confirmed your team of instructors and helpers, use a
messenging app (WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, or Slack) to set up a group chat
that supports easy communication.

### First day

- In the room, arrange the tables into groups for each of the teams.
As participants come in, get them to sit in their assigned team by referring to
the team lists placed in the middle of each table.
- Arrange the tables so no participant needs to twist or turn their neck in order to type.
- During the introduction, introduce all the instructors and helpers.
- Some time during the introduction session, 
get them to stand in line and arrange themselves from 
"complete beginner" to "know a little bit" for R, 
data analysis, and programming.
During the introduction, 
describe the assignment and what's the purposes of the teams.
- Before the lunch break, get the groups to have lunch together 
and introduce each other more. 
Get them to say their program, if they've used R before, 
some struggles they've had with R and with data analysis in general, 
and/or why they want to learn R.

### About using surveys

We used Google Forms to create surveys for pre-, during-, and post-course
feedback and questionnaires. The purpose of using surveys in the current context
is purely to gain feedback on aspects of the course that could be improved
in future iterations, such as the "pace" of material being presented.

The interface for creating surveys is quite clear and functions are very intuitive. 
You will see a floating menu to the right of your template where you can add 
questions etc. One particularly useful tool is the ability to duplicate question and answer
matrices. If you are using this course material to run your own independent workshop
and want the surveys to use as a template that you can then customize,
create a [new issue](https://gitlab.com/rostools/r-cubed/-/issues/new) to request
access.

We included survey links as a function within the r3 package so learners can quickly 
access the survey. Creating surveys is quite easy with Google Forms. Below are a 
list of questions to include (depending on the survey):

- **Pre-course**:
    - Basic questions about the participant (position, name, place of work).
    - Questions about perceived skill/knowledge on using R, programming, data
    analysis, and version control.
    - Questions related to their pre-course tasks.
    - Feedback on the pre-course tasks, like: What worked well? What could be improved?
- **Daily feedback**:
    - For each session, we asked: What worked well? What could be improved?
    - For final session, we asked broader quantitative comments like: I think I
    learned a lot; I think the instructors communicated clearly; I think there 
    was good alignment between content and delivery.
- **Post-course**:
    - Basic questions about the participant (like in the pre-course survey).
    - Questions about current usage of the tools they learned during the course.
    - Questions about and reflections on the course.
