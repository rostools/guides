# Admin and running a workshop üè´

The [r3admin](https://github.com/rostools/r3admin) R helper package
automates many aspects of running the workshop, at least at the
administrative and coordinating side of things. Read the documentation
there to see how to use that package to streamline admin tasks.

## Instructors and helpers doing the workshop

-   The recommended number of instructors for a 25-35 class size is
    about 3-6 instructors (\~1 instructors for every 3 hrs of workshop time). If
    there are more instructors, than less helpers are needed.

-   A recommended ratio of instructor/helper to participant is about 1
    to 5-7, which we've found ensures the smoothest learning experience.

-   Once you have confirmed your team of instructors and helpers, use a
    communication app like Discord to set up a group chat that supports easy
    communication.

-   For new instructors, consider having them instruct only one 1.5 hour session,
    while experienced instructors can do two 1.5 hour sessions.

## Before the workshop

The function `r3admin::admin_create_planning_issue()` in the r3admin
package creates an issue to help manage the workshop that includes
a checklist of things to do. Check the r3admin package for documentation 
on it. A basic checklist to prepare for or have for the workshop is:

-   Bring colourful origami hats (for the laptops) or post-it notes
    for participants to let us know how they are doing. Either one you
    use, find very bright colours for them, like bright blue and bright 
    orange.

-   Check that participants completed the pre-workshop tasks

-   Depending on the workshop, setup the R Project beforehand so that the
    instructors can use it. Create as a Git repo and push up to GitHub, so
    instructors can clone the project before their session.

-   If there is group work, keep group size to 2 learners per group. Any
    more and they end up starting to split into smaller groups within
    the group. 

    -   If there are groups, randomize it so participants go with random
        people. Since workshops are also a chance to network and meet new
        people, forcing them into groups with new people helps to set
        the atmosphere so that everyone intentionally doesn't know the
        others (though they might by chance). Having people randomly
        assigned to groups also reduces the anxiety associated with
        "having to find or make a group".

## The first day

-   Make sure to have the first slides up on the projector as participants
    come in, since it gives them some instructions on what to do.

-   Make sure the tables are arranged to participants are facing the
    projector, so they don't twist their necks

    -   If there are groups, keep groups connected together in tables,
        have space between the groups for instructors and helpers to
        walk through
    -   Arrange it so participants go to their assigned tables as they
        enter by putting their, for instance, name tags or names at the
        table.

-   During the introduction, don't forget to introduce all the
    instructors and helpers.

-   In the room, arrange the tables into groups for each of the teams.
    As participants come in, get them to sit in their assigned team by
    referring to the team lists placed in the middle of each table.

-   (Optional idea) Before the lunch break, get the groups to have lunch
    together and introduce each other more. Get them to say their
    program, if they've used R before, some struggles they've had with R
    and with data analysis in general, and/or why they want to learn R.

## During the workshop

-   Be more strict about time management of exercises (move on even if
    they don't finish).

-   Use a timer set to 45-50 minutes throughout the workshop, so that we can
    have regular, short 5 minute breaks. Using a timer will force us to 
    remember this.

## End of the workshop

-   **End of workshop**: Ask if any participant would like to be involved
    in next year's teaching, or in making the material, or in being a
    helper.

-   Always do a workshop debrief with all the instructors on what
    worked and what could be improved after the workshop finishes. It's
    also a time to give peer feedback. See the 
    [instructor](instructors.qmd#after-the-workshop) section for more details.

## General workshop admin

### About using surveys

We used Google Forms to create surveys for pre-, during-, and
post-workshop feedback and questionnaires. The purpose of using surveys in
the current context is purely to gain feedback on aspects of the workshop
that could be improved in future iterations, such as the "pace" of
material being presented.

The interface for creating surveys is quite clear and functions are very
intuitive. You will see a floating menu to the right of your template
where you can add questions etc. One particularly useful tool is the
ability to duplicate question and answer matrices. If you are using this
workshop material to run your own independent workshop and want the
surveys to use as a template that you can then customize, create a [new
issue](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-intro/issues/new) to request
access.

We included survey links as a function within the r3 package so learners
can quickly access the survey. Creating surveys is quite easy with
Google Forms. Below are a list of questions to include (depending on the
survey):

-   **Pre-workshop**:
    -   Basic questions about the participant (position, name, place of
        work).
    -   Questions about perceived skill/knowledge on using R,
        programming, data analysis, and version control.
    -   Questions related to their pre-workshop tasks.
    -   Feedback on the pre-workshop tasks, like: What worked well? What
        could be improved?
-   **Daily feedback**:
    -   For each session, we asked: What worked well? What could be
        improved?
    -   For final session, we asked broader quantitative comments like:
        I think I learned a lot; I think the instructors communicated
        clearly; I think there was good alignment between content and
        delivery.
-   **Post-workshop**:
    -   Basic questions about the participant (like in the pre-workshop
        survey).
    -   Questions about current usage of the tools they learned during
        the workshop.
    -   Questions about and reflections on the workshop.

### About the r3 package

The r3 package is used as a companion and helper throughout this workshop
to making it easier to do certain tasks like go to the survey or install
packages necessary for the workshop. Considering this, if you want to use
this workshop material and run a workshop like this on your own, you can
clone the r3 package and modify it as necessary for your own purposes.
See the [README](https://github.com/rostools/r3/blob/main/README.md) of
the r3 package for more details.
